# Enhancing Large Language Models with STaR and Verification Methodologies

## Overview
This project integrates the methodologies of "STaR: Self-Taught Reasoner" and "Letâ€™s Verify Step by Step" to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4. The script provided is a conceptual representation, focusing on the integration of the Ollama platform or Hugging Face models with process supervision and synthetic data generation.

## Key Considerations
- **Ollama Integration**: Requires setting up the Ollama platform and using the correct endpoint URL.
- **Model Selection**: A suitable model from Hugging Face can be chosen based on task complexity.
- **Synthetic Label Generation**: Currently uses a basic random method. Implement a more sophisticated heuristic or a smaller model for better accuracy.
- **Process Reward Model (PRM)**: Placeholder class, requiring specific implementation details.
